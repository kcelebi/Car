# Car

This is a project dedicated to providing a solution to traffic, in the context of a max-flow problem. The first part of this project, located in folder V1 is a simulation of traffic in a small, isolated city system. The second part, located in folder V2, uses data from the first to create an algorithm that adds n new roads to a system to alleviate traffic as much as possible.
(V2 code retracted, new changes being implemented, stick around to see them soon)
